###Nyan Cat Creation
This project is an assignment to learn JavaScript. It's just the beginning. I was assigned an exercise to create a page with Nyan Cat with different objectives:
1. Create a button
2. When you click the button, it should start raining Nyan Cats (Nyan cat images falling down over 45 degrees, top left to bottom right, start with one)
3. Make the rain stop after 10 seconds
4. While it's raining Nyan Cats, the background should become the one from the original animation and all the other elements should disappear until it's done raining cats ;)
5. Where would nyan cat be without the annoying soundtrack on top of it, play the song while it's raining nyan cats

Bonus:
1. Multiply the amount of nyan cats by a random amount
2. Randomize the speed of the falling nyan cats
3. Randomize the angle of the nyan cats
4. Randomize the starting position of the nyan cats
